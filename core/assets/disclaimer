Hey <subject name here>,

Why fight [red]fire (o7)[] with fire if you can do so with [royal]water (o2)[] instead?

This fork's goal is to be an [accent]anti-griefing client[],
with perhaps some useful stuff thrown in along the way.

While this fork is aimed at doing good, its code can/may be used or recoded for malicious purposes.
(shoutout to [accent]iczero[] for making his client, sad it's development suffered because of that)

I understand that this client may befall the same fate,
but such is the way with anything, [accent]security through obscurity[] is best avoided.

So please, if you use this client (and managed to find [accent]this[] dialog), use common sense [green]:)[]
